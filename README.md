## How It's Made

The Fluidsense protocol is built upon a powerful combination of cutting-edge technologies:

- **Superfluid**: Fluidsense utilizes Superfluid to create streams that reward users who fulfill the criteria set by the marketing campaigns.

- **Lens**: Lens is employed to define and deploy the marketing campaigns, providing a streamlined approach to campaign management.

- **Worldcoin**: Fluidsense leverages the Worldcoin protocol to verify the authenticity of users subscribing to the campaign, ensuring that only real humans are participating.

The entire protocol will be deployed on the Polygon chain, ensuring scalability and efficient execution.
